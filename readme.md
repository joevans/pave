* P.A.V.E (Professionals Advising Veterans Everyday)
Paving the Way for Veterans

* Purpose 
Connecting Veterans with professionals willing and able to help them succeed in civilian life.  

* Immediate Goals
For right now I am focus on creating an information site to let people know about PAVE and to contact the right people to get involved.  

Eventually it will need to do the following:
1.  Provide Vets with information about succeeding in Civilian life (info)
2.  Provide Vets with Job opportunties in their area. (jobs)
3.  Provide Volunteers and Pavers a way to sign up to connect with Vets they are best suited to help. (pavers)
4.  Provide Vets with someone they can connect with about reaching their civilian goals (paver-to-vets)

 This site will provide a start point from which we will eventually create a site which will accomplish this.  
 For now we will focus on milestone 1.
